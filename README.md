# 🧠 ThinkBoard – A MERN Notes App

ThinkBoard is a modern, full-stack **MERN-based Notes App** built for speed and simplicity. It allows users to create, edit, and manage their notes with a beautiful and responsive UI.

### 🚀 Live Demo

> 🟡 **Note:** The app is deployed on [Render.com’s free tier](https://render.com/docs/free#spin-down), which means it may take **10–30 seconds** to load initially if it has been inactive. This is not a performance issue — it's a limitation of Render's free hosting, where services "spin down" after inactivity to conserve resources.
